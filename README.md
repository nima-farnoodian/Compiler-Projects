# Compiler-Projects.

    In this repository, you will find the source code related to our
    programming language called Rime. We designed Rime for our course
    project "Languages and Translation". In order to get a gist of Rime, the
    designing approach, and the used technologies, please read the project
    definition and our sequential reports found in the related directories.
